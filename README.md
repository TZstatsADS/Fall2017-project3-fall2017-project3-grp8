+ Project summary: In this project, we created a classification engine for images of poodles, fried chickens, and blueberry muffins. We set our baseline model using SIFT features and gradient boosting machine(GBM) classifier. Besides the SIFT features, we also tried GIST and HOG (Histogram of oriented Gradient) descriptors. In terms of classifiers, we considered SVM(Linear and RBF kernel), Random Forest, XGBoost, Logistic Regression, Neural Network, and GBM. After model evaluation and comparison, the final advanced model we selected is using HOG descriptor and a majority vote of XGBoost, Linear SVM, and RBF-kernel SVM classifiers. We increased the accuracy by % and only took % of running time as in baseline model.
